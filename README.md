## Introduction

Build a classifier to predict whether a customer will ("soon") stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. Note that this is a **binary** classification problem.

Most naturally, your audience here would be the telecom business itself, interested in losing money on customers who don't stick around very long. Are there any predictable patterns here?
